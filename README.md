#GitMyStory

When I was younger I didn't know EAST from West
Yet I thought I could cherry pick knowledge
Like thoughts on a Test

Little did I know, how much did I find
Too large to live in,
too little to leave mankind

I git a promise
I take a stand

I didn't upload my story
I forked a whole new category

No last thoughts stil remain
No last victory to ascertain
No regrets given
Because I have my sin forgiven

I may be one in 7 billion in this world I call my own,
But in His eyes, I am no one's git clone.
